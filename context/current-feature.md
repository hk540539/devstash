In Progress

## Goals

Refactor: split large files and extract shared utilities

1. Extract `formatBytes` to `src/lib/format.ts` (used in FileListRow + ItemDrawer)
2. Extract extension icon map + `getExtensionIcon` to `src/lib/file-utils.ts`
3. Move profile server actions to `src/actions/profile.ts`
4. Extract shared URL validation to `src/lib/schemas/items.ts`, update `src/actions/items.ts`
5. Extract shared tag upsert helper inside `src/lib/db/items.ts`
6. Split `ItemDrawer.tsx` (659 lines) into `ItemDrawerSkeleton`, `ItemDrawerDetail`, `ItemDrawerEdit`
7. Split `DashboardLayout.tsx` — extract `SidebarBody`, `UserAvatar`, `UserFooter` to separate files

## Notes

- All splits are pure extractions — no behavior changes
- UserAvatar in DashboardLayout is a local duplicate; a shared one already exists at src/components/ui/user-avatar.tsx (check first)
- Profile actions already re-fetch session internally so they move cleanly to a module-level 'use server' file

## History

- Markdown Editor completed — `MarkdownEditor` component with Write/Preview tabs, copy button, Monaco-matched scrollbar, 200px min / 400px max fluid height; `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `@tailwindcss/typography` (`prose-invert`) for GFM rendering in dark theme; replaces textarea for Note and Prompt types in `NewItemDialog`, `DrawerEdit`, and `ItemDrawer` view mode (readonly)

- Item Delete completed — Delete button in drawer opens AlertDialog confirmation; `deleteItem` server action with auth check; `deleteItemById` in `src/lib/db/items.ts`; Sonner toast on success; drawer closes and list refreshes via `router.refresh()`

- File & Image Upload completed — `@aws-sdk/client-s3` + Supabase S3-compatible storage; `src/lib/s3.ts` singleton client; `POST /api/upload` with type/size validation (5 MB max); `GET /api/download/[...key]` authenticated proxy with ownership check; `FileUpload` component with drag-and-drop, XHR progress bar, post-upload download button; NewItemDialog supports File and Image types (upload required before create, type switch clears upload); ItemDrawer shows image preview and file name/size/download; `deleteItemById` cleans up S3 on item delete; Prisma transactions use `maxWait/timeout` for Neon serverless stability
- Image Gallery View completed — `ImageThumbnailCard` with `aspect-video`, `object-cover`, 5% hover zoom (300ms transition); `ItemsGridWithDrawer` accepts `layout` prop; `/items/images` renders gallery layout, all other type pages unchanged; `fileUrl` + `fileName` added to `ItemWithMeta` and `itemSelect`; drawer open-on-click preserved
- File List View completed — `FileListRow` with extension-based icon (PDF/ZIP/code/audio/video/etc.), file name, size, date, download button (stops propagation); responsive mobile stacking; `ItemsGridWithDrawer` supports `layout="list"`; `/items/files` uses list layout; `fileSize` added to `ItemWithMeta`, `itemSelect`, and `mapItem`
- Security & Performance Audit Fixes completed — `updateItemById` ownership check (findFirst + userId in update where to prevent IDOR); rate limiting added to `POST /api/auth/register` (3/hr by IP, matching Server Action); `getItemsByType` collapsed from two sequential queries to one `findMany` with nested type filter
